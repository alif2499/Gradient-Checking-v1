# Gradient-Checking-v1
Welcome to the final assignment for this week! In this assinment, you will learn how to implement and use gradient checking.  You are part of a team working to make mobile payments available globally, and are asked to build a deep learning model to detect fraud--whenever someone makes a payment, you want to see if the payment might be fraudulent, such as if the user's account has been taken over by a hacker.  But backpropagation is quite challenging to implement, and sometimes has bugs. Because this is a mission-critical application, your company's CEO wants to be really certain that your implementation of backpropagation is correct. Your CEO says, "Give me a proof that your backpropagation is actually working!" To give this reassurance, you are going to use "gradient checking".
